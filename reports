# Bug Hunt 101 — Recon to Report

## Introduction
This report documents vulnerabilities discovered during testing of Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) in a controlled lab environment. The purpose is to demonstrate a complete bug bounty workflow from reconnaissance to reporting.

---

## Reconnaissance

### Tool Used
- Nmap

### Command Executed
```bash
nmap -sC -sV -oN nmap_scan.txt 127.0.0.1


### Reflected XSS (Proof)
![XSS Alert](../screenshots/xss_alert1.png)

### Reflected XSS (Proof)
![XSS Alert](.../screenshots/xss.alert2.png)
Vulnerability 1: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Description
Reflected XSS occurs when user input is reflected back in the response without proper sanitization, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript.
Steps to Reproduce
Open DVWA
Navigate to XSS (Reflected)
Enter the payload:
<script>alert(1)</script>

### SQL Injection (Proof)
![SQLi Dump](../screenshots/sqli_dump.png)
Vulnerability 2: SQL Injection (SQLi)
Description
SQL Injection allows attackers to manipulate backend database queries by injecting malicious SQL statements.
Steps to Reproduce
Navigate to SQL Injection in DVWA
Enter:
' OR '1'='1

### Burp Suite Evidence
![Burp Proxy](../screenshots/burp_proxy.png)
Description
Burp Suite was used to intercept HTTP requests to observe and manipulate traffic between the browser and the application.


## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrated reconnaissance, vulnerability identification, exploitation, and professional documentation within a safe lab environment.
