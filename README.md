# Bug Hunt 101 — Recon to Report

This repository contains an introductory cybersecurity project with a focus on reconnaissance, vulnerability, discovery, exploitation, and professional report using a vulnerable web application. The aim is to demonstrate process.

## Objectives
- Perform reconnaissance using Nmap
- Identify and exploit common web vulnerabilities
- Document findings professionally

## Vulnerabilities Identified
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- SQL Injection

## Tools Used
- DVWA
- Nmap
- Burp Suite (Community Edition)
- Firefox
- Kali Linux
- SQLMAP

## Repository Structure
- /report — vulnerability report
- /recon — reconnaissance results
- /screenshots — proof of exploitation

  ## Method Used
  1. ## Environment Setup
     confirm the vulnerable application is working.
  2. ## Reconnaissance
     Identify the target and perform basic network scanning.
  3. ## Vulnerability Discovery
     Test application inputs for common web vulnerabilities.
  4. ## Exploitation & Proof
     Craft payloads to confirm the vulnerability exists.
  5. ## Reporting
     Document the vulnerability with reproduction steps, proof, impact, and mitigation.
